# ESP MQTT Digital LEDs for Home Assistant

This project shows a super easy way to get started using WS2811 Digital LED strips with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/), a sick, open-source Home Automation platform that can do just about anything. 

The code covered in this repository allows controlling the strip via a traditional RGB color selector with brightness. There are also pre-defined animations that can be triggered using the Input Select component in Home Assistant. Some of these effects incorporate the currrently selected color (Sinelon, Confetti, Juggle, etc) while other effects use pre-defined colors. Besides colors and effects, this project supports using MQTT-defined global brightness and an animation speed selector. When the strip is turned off, a hardcoded slow fade ends the animation nicely.
